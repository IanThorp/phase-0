1. What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
  1. Information Gathering
    In this phase you are figuring out the general direction a website will go.Things to consider are purpose, goals, target audience, and content (specifically, what features or information you will provide.
  2. Planning
    This is where you make your site map. Keep in mind all of the research you did in information gathering. Make sure your website has the skeleton to effectively maintain the purpose, goals, and content.
  3. Design
    The target audience you researched in information gathering is very important here. You must make it appealing to your end-user. This could affect ease of use as well as the look of the website. Often, this is just a picture, or group of pictures, of what the website will look like.
  4. Development
    This is where you get down to the nitty gritty of writing the code. Using HTML/CSS you will build to website to the standards of the design you created earlier.
  5. Testing and Delivery
    Now we have a functioning website. This phase requires testing of all links and forms, making sure everything works as expected. Also, you must make sure this works on different browsers and devices. Search engine optimization can be done, as well as uploading to the server that will host the website.
  6. Maintenance
    This phase can include adding new content to keep users coming back. It also requires plugin updates and maintaining compatibility with the newest browsers and devices.

2. What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
  My sites primary goal is to showcase myself and my work to employers to acquire a job. My site will feature past work that I am proud of. I could also showcase some opportunities to teach about common coding practices as a way to show that I know what I am talking about.

3. What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
  My target audience interests will predominantly be my portfolio and my contact information. I will try to design my website to make links to these the easiest to find.

4. What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
  Primarily, I want them to see my portfolio. After they have viewed this, they can decide if they want to contact me, so secondary will be my contact information.

5. What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
  User experience and design is basically about making the user enjoy your website. This could be through being able to efficiently find things, making it look more attractive, easier to access everything, or a combination of all of the above. Keep in mind how a person would interact with your website and make it as enjoyable as possible.

6. What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
  User experience design is the process of figuring otu how a user would interact with teh website, and making it as fluid and enjoyable as possible. User experience is very valuable. The more a user likes your website, the more likely they are to come back.

7. Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
  Honestly, most of it did not seem tedious. The only thing that was a little tedious was question 5 and 6 in the review. They seemed very similar and could probably be combined in one question.
