<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was fun and interesting. It was really nice to actually be able to think through a problem without having my hand held the whole way. This allowed me to learn a little bit more effectively.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It is neat to see just how many other types of elements there are in HTML5. One can definitely do a lot with HTML.
- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  We did pretty good.  We decided to go a little above and beyond and try to create the original site (Not the picture given to us in the challenge) as closesly as possible. We were not able to do this (using good techniques) in just HTML, but certainly got pretty close.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  HTML seems to be a ridiculously easy to understand language. Reading through our site, I can see exactly where everything is and what it does. With that, styling is very tough to do, but that is what CSS is for!
- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I guess I don't really have any fancy tricks, just lots and lots of flash cards.
