1. What is a wireframe?
  A wireframe is basically the layout of how a website will look. Where headers, footers, text boxes, links, and images will go. This is usually shown with a simple jpg or similar.

2. What are the benefits of wireframing?
  Wireframing can be like a rough draft. They are generally quick to make but can give you a good idea of how attractive the website will be and how easy everything is to access. They are also very nice for giving clients or collaborators a good idea of what direction the website is headed in without going through all the work of coding it. Changes will be much easier to make at this point.

3. Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
  Yes, it was good to have an idea what the website will look like.

4. Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
  I did some minor revisions just to make things easier to find. The general gist of the website stayed the same.

5. What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
  I did not have a good picture in my head of what I wanted my site to look like. I wanted to look at some examples. I looked up wireframes of other sites, just to see some options. I went with something similar to what I found on google images.

6. Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
  I enjoyed seeing my layout on the screen. Some of these questions are bit tedious. I feel like question three and question six could easily be combined into one question.
