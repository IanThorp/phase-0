  <h1>Version Control in Git and GitHub</h1>

    <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
    <p>
       Version control is a system that keeps track of your files and remembers all of the changes youâ€™ve made and when you made them.
       Benefits include:
       <ul>
        <li>Changes are orderly.</li>
        <li>Everyone on the team is able to work freely, on any file at any time.</li>
        <li>You can experiment at will.</li>
        <li>You can look at previous versions of the code to find out when and where bugs occured.</li>
        <li>It is easy to roll back to an earlier version of the information, if a serious mistake was made during a change.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>

        <p>
          Git is extremely fast and modern. Git utilize version control by not just keeping track of your own files, it facilitate collaboration and keep track of all the changes made by any member of the group. We can all work on the same files at the same time. Git make sense of it all and commits are merged and all information are compiled into a new document.
       </p>
       <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>

         <p>
        Now, as developers, we of course want to collaborate with others. Often times, we won't be able to simply use the same computer, or directly email updates to all of our partners. This is where Github comes in. Github allows us to have all of our code in the cloud, accesible by anyone we want at anytime, even simultaneously. Once any of these individuals is happy with their code, they can upload it to Github.  These changes must now be reviewed by someone else, before they merge back in with your master copy of the code. Safeties like this help protect the code from bugs being introduced on accident, but still allow relatively natural and easy co-working.
