        <h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
        <p>
       Version control is a system that keeps track of your files and remembers all of the changes youâ€™ve made and when you made them.
       Benefits include:
        <ul>
          <li>Changes are orderly.</li>
          <li>Everyone on the team is able to work freely, on any file at any time.</li>
          <li>You can experiment at will.</li>
          <li>You can look at previous versions of the code to find out when and where bugs occured.</li>
          <li>It is easy to roll back to an earlier version of the information, if a serious mistake was made during a change.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>

        <p>
          Git is extremely fast and modern. Git utilize version control by not just keeping track of your own files, it facilitate collaboration and keep track of all the changes made by any member of the group. We can all work on the same files at the same time. Git make sense of it all and commits are merged and all information are compiled into a new document.
        </p>
        <h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>

         <p>
        Now, as developers, we of course want to collaborate with others. Often times, we won't be able to simply use the same computer, or directly email updates to all of our partners. This is where Github comes in. Github allows us to have all of our code in the cloud, accesible by anyone we want at anytime, even simultaneously. Once any of these individuals is happy with their code, they can upload it to Github.  These changes must now be reviewed by someone else, before they merge back in with your master copy of the code. Safeties like this help protect the code from bugs being introduced on accident, but still allow relatively natural and easy co-working.

1. What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
  There are basic ones that are always needed. These would be html, body, and head. Title is used almost always as well, since you always want your page to have a title. h1, h2, and h3 seem to be used a lot to get any kind of headigns on various sections of the page. Header and footer are useful as well since most of my pages will have something like a header and a footer.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
  Elements are all laid out in sections. Each element will have its own styling basically. The elements are displayed in top to bottom order from what I could tell.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
  Sublime can definitely make coding a lot quicker. These snippets are great for giving you code that you seem to always be wasting time writing. Depending on what I end up making, I will definitely make some custom snippets and use already pre loaded ones too.
