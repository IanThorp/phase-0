1. Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
  https://github.com/IanThorp/IanThorp.github.io.git

2. Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
  1. Log in to your profile on Github.com.
  2. Click on the plus button in the upper right hand corner (next to avatar) than click  "New repository" on the drop down menu.
  3. Follow the instructions on Github for naming your repository, setting it to public or private, and choosing the type of license.
  4. Click create repository near the bottom of the page.
  5. Copy the HTTPS link to your clipboard. (This is located near the top, in the middle.)
  6. Now go to the terminal on your computer.
  7. Navigate to the proper location for your git repository.
  8. Type the command "git clone <link>" where <link> is replaced with your HTTPS link you copied earlier.

3. Describe what open source means.
  Open source means that the user has access to the source code and is free to redistribute it. This means, unlike closed source, the user can edit and modify the source code of a program to their hearts desire. Changing, adding, or deleting anything to make it their own and then sell or give it to anyone else.
4. What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
  Open Source seems like a great idea for almost all code. It will benefit the community as a whole, since there is no limits to who can improve the code. Just think about all the great ideas people have for programs and setting no limits to what they will add. It will create a great program, with hopefully tremendous community support for more additions along the way. It is understandable that some code is not open source. For example, it would be much more difficult for Microsoft to make any money on their investment in creating Windows operating system if the code was freely available to everyone. Overall, open source is great for the community.

5. Assess the importance of using licenses.
  Licenses help maintain the intention of the author of the code. There are many different licenses and they allow for different permissions to users for things like copying, distrubiting, and modyfing.
  For example, the GNU General Public license allows for anyone to copy, modify,distribute however they please, and charge any distribution fee they want. The one caveat is this license requires all derivatives or copies be accompanied with a copy of this license. The GNU Lesser General Public license is similar, but does not require the license to be passed on to proprietary code.
  The MIT license, which I am using, is one of the most open licenses.  It allows basically anything to be done to the software by the anyone. A copy of the MIT license must accompany it. GPL is slightly more restrictive because the GPL license applies to all the code, even if only a section was copied for another source cod under GPL.  The MIT license does not require the rest of the code to fall under the MIT license.

6. What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
  At this point I love getting as much practice pushing, pulling, and cloning in git and from/to Github. Just getting the commands down in proper order is a nice thing to solidify. It definetly was an awesome feeling to build my first website, even though it is simple.
  I struggled a bit with determining the difference between the many licenses out there. I feel there is still much to learn as well.

7. Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  Basically googling "What is the difference between <license-1> and <license-2>" helped a lot. Getting direct comparisons from question and answer sites like quora and stackoverflow.
