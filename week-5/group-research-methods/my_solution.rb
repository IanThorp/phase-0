#my_array_modification_method! will modify an array. It adds a number, which is input as an argument, to all integers present in the array.
#my_hash_modification_method! will modify a hash. It adds a number, which is input as an argument, to all the values in the hash.

# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
