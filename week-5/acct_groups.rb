# Pseudocode

# What is the input?
  # the input will be an array of names

# What is the output?
  # output will be a hash, keys will be accountability group number, and values will be an array of the names of members.

# Write some pseudocode for it.
  # Create number of arrays for how many people you have.
  # Number of arrays should allow every array to have 4 or 5 people, but at least 3 people.
  # Iterate over arrays and insert one person at a time
  # Create Hash with number of keys equal to number of arrays
  # Set each array as the value for a different hash key.
  # PUTS each hash, key pair on their own line.

#Reflection

# What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

#   The most difficult part was figuring out how to make all of the groups as close to even as possible. The most interesting had to have been discovering that there is a shuffle method to randomize the array. That seems useful

# Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

#   I definitely feel like I am improving and quickly. I know more and more about how ruby operates. That helps me know exactly what angle I should attack a problem from.

# Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

#   I think my approach was a very good solution. I could have added maybe another feature or two. For example, what happens if someone leaves the cohort. Also, how can I save the results of previous code.

# What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

#   I decided to store it each individual group in an array, which was inside of a hash. This allowed me to keep all of the groups in one structure, but also keep each individual group seperate.

# What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

#   I learned about the shuffle method. This helped me randomize the array so that the output would be different every time.
